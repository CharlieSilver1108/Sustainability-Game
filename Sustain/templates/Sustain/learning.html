                            <h3 class="card-title">What You Can Do</h3>
                            <p class="mb-1">There are simple changes you can make to live more sustainably and reduce your carbon footprint. Recycling is an easy step. Also consider how you shop, study and get to campus - each change, however small, is a move towards being more sustainable. There are also a range of opportunities to get involved with sustainability initiatives, such as volunteering, biodiversity projects and the community garden.</p>

                            <p class="mb-1">The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 goals which provide a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. They are at the heart of 'The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development', which was adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015.</p>
                            <p class="mb-1">The University of Exeter is committed to the SDGs and has a range of initiatives and projects to support them. These include the Living Systems Institute, the Global Systems Institute, and the Exeter Climate Assembly.<br></p>

                            <p class="mb-1">We are Scrum Buddies, a passionate and tight-knit team of student developers committed to promoting sustainability through education. Our mission is to make learning about sustainability not just accessible, but also engaging and enjoyable. We believe that everyone has a role to play in protecting our planet, and we want to empower individuals to make a difference in their own unique ways. That's why we created Sustain, an innovative game that combines education and action in a fun and interactive way. In Sustain, players can challenge their knowledge about sustainability, participate in community activities, and earn XP to track their contributions. The game is designed to be both informative and entertaining, providing players with a rewarding experience as they learn about sustainability and take steps to implement sustainable practices in their daily lives. Join us in our journey towards a more sustainable future. Play, learn, and make a difference with Sustain.</p>
