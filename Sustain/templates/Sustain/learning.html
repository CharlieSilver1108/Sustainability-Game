                            <p class="mb-1">There are simple changes you can make to live more sustainably and reduce your carbon footprint. Recycling is an easy step. Also consider how you shop, study and get to campus - each change, however small, is a move towards being more sustainable. There are also a range of opportunities to get involved with sustainability initiatives, such as volunteering, biodiversity projects and the community garden.</p>

                        <h3 class="card-title mt-5">What We Are Doing</h3>
                            <p class="mb-1">The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 goals which provide a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. They are at the heart of 'The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development', which was adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015.</p>
                            <p class="mb-1">The University of Exeter is committed to the SDGs and has a range of initiatives and projects to support them. These include the Living Systems Institute, the Global Systems Institute, and the Exeter Climate Assembly.</p>
