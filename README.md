### About:
This is a group project, completed as an assignment for a Year 2 Module at the University of Exeter, using full-stack development. It was completed via use of the python-based web framework Django.

### The Project Description:
The University has an ambitious sustainability goal to have a carbon net zero impact by 2030 [1]. To achieve this goal the University will need to increase awareness of the positive and negative contributors to sustainability and environmental impact of activities around campus and promote positive change to the behaviour of people and policy. This project's aim is to create a system that will help people engage with sustainability on campus. This should be achieved by raising awareness of the changes required to meet the goals set out by the University. In an attempt to grow and retain the engagement of users, teams will use a persuasive gamification application built on the Django web platform that uses locations around campus and user profiles. The game should be persuasive, fun, dynamic and encourage users to engage with University students, staff, facilities and resources along the way.
